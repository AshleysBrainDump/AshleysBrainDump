- 👋 Hi, I’m @AshleysBrainDump, or Ashley Woodruff
- 👀 I’m interested in learning Programming and presenting my Project to the World!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning programming with Arduinos, Web stuff (HTML, CSS, Javascript), and Game developement (Godot)
- 💞️ I’m more of a Loner when it comes to projects, so I dont know what my stance on Collaborating is.
- 📫 How to reach me: Right now, dont?
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am a fan of a flavor in Germany named "Waldmeister", which literally translates to "Woodruff". Hence the Last name I decided on.
